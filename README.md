# CreateFibril v 2.5

##About:

	CreateFibril is a tool to build atomic resolution models of protein fibrils. 
	Starting with the PDB file of an amyloid structure, one can specify the structural 
	parameters needed to build polymorphic fibrils. H-bond distances specify the 
	distances in angstroms between aggregated monomers on a fibril, rotation angels 
	specifies the fibril twist in degrees, and the polymorphism type selects the number 
	and orientation of the filaments making up the fibril.
